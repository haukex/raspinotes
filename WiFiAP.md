Raspberry Pi as Wi-Fi Access Point
==================================

**Important:** Do this *last*, because installing stuff via reverse proxy
can be a bit of a pain!

The following instructions were updated Dec 2023 based on the
current [official RPi documentation on the topic][link1]
and tested on the new Bookworm-based Raspberry Pi OS Lite.

[link1]: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#host-a-wireless-network-on-your-raspberry-pi

- Assuming you're using `ufw`:

      sudo ufw allow DNS
      sudo ufw allow from any port 68 to any port 67 proto udp comment DHCP

- To set up and enable the WiFi AP, do the following. (Note: if you're currently connected to the RPi
  via WiFi, the first command will immediately start up the AP and kill your connection.)

      sudo nmcli device wifi hotspot con-name Hotspot ssid <SSID> password <Password>
      sudo nmcli connection modify Hotspot ipv4.addresses 192.168.42.1/24 \
          autoconnect TRUE connection.autoconnect-priority 1
      sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

- If you keep the WiFi client connection you had previously, and you want to switch back to that:

      sudo nmcli connection modify Hotspot autoconnect FALSE connection.autoconnect-priority 0
      sudo nmcli connection down Hotspot

  If you don't want to keep the client connection, then you can simply delete it,
  and the above `autoconnect-priority` settings are not needed.

- Tips:
  - Short device and connection list: `nmcli device` and `nmcli connection`
    (can also be abbreviated `nmcli d` and `nmcli c`); details via `nmcli c show <con-name>`
  - Documentation on NetworkManager settings: `man nm-settings` and <https://networkmanager.dev/docs/man-pages/>
  - `sudo nmtui` is a curses-based NetworkManager configuration tool that can do (almost) all of the above
    (it apparently doesn't support changing the `autoconnect` settings).


Previous Manual Instructions
----------------------------

**Unmaintained:** Assuming the above `nmcli` method continues to work well for me, I will eventually delete this section.

- Initial steps
  
      sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq
      sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
      sudo systemctl stop hostapd
      sudo cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig
      sudo ufw allow DNS
      sudo ufw allow from any port 68 to any port 67 proto udp comment DHCP
  
- `sudo vi /etc/dhcpcd.conf` and add the lines:
  
      interface wlan0
      static ip_address=192.168.42.1/24
      static domain_name_servers=192.168.42.1
      nohook wpa_supplicant
  
- `sudo vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf` and add the lines:
  
      interface=wlan0
      domain-needed
      bogus-priv
      dhcp-range=192.168.42.100,192.168.42.150
      domain=internal
      address=/YOURHOSTNAME.internal/192.168.42.1
  
- `sudo vi /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf` and create or replace contents with:
  
      interface=wlan0
      driver=nl80211
      ssid=YOUR_SSID_HERE
      hw_mode=g
      country_code=DE
      channel=5
      wmm_enabled=0
      macaddr_acl=0
      auth_algs=1
      ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
      wpa=2
      wpa_passphrase=YOUR_PASSPHRASE_HERE
      wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
      wpa_pairwise=TKIP
      rsn_pairwise=CCMP
  
- `sudo vi /etc/default/hostapd` and set
  `DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"`
  
- Start things up:
  
      sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
      sudo reboot
  
- To disable temporarily:
  - `sudo systemctl disable hostapd`
  - `sudo vi /etc/dhcpcd.conf` and comment out the lines added above
  - `sudo reboot`

Access Point + Client
---------------------

**TODO** I tried the following, but this caused connection instability.
I need to investigate further.

First do:

        echo 'KERNEL=="wlan0", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/usr/sbin/iw dev %k interface add uap0 type __ap"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/90-wlan.rules

And then use `uap0` instead of `wlan0` in the instructions above.
